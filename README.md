# Verilog-Vivado
Sequence detector for a LFSR using Finite State Machine on Basys 3 FPGA board


Project description• Used Verilog for designing and programming the FPGA board.
• Made a new clock module to using the existing clock and linear feedback shift register was used to generate pseudo-random numbers..
• Designed the Finite state machine for the sequence.
• A counter module to keep track of the sequence when encountered.
• Testbenches were made to cover each case.
• Model was targeted to the Board and tested.
